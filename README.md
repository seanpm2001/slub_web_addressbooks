## Dependancy to Kitodo.Presentation

A local Kitodo.Presentation instance has been used to verify if a certain PPN is available. Unfortunately this doesn't work anymore after Upgrade to TYPO3 9.5 as the Digitale Sammlungen are not on the same system anymore.

To check the availability, it's easy to ask the Solr-Server.

But how do we get the "Beh√∂rdenverzeichnis" (Table Of Contents) etc.? This can only be done by parsing the METS by ourself.
